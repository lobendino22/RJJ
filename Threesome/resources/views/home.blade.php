      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
        We are <strong>Rodel, Jaby, and John Loise</strong>, three close friends who have been together since our first year in college. 
        As <strong>BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) students</strong>, we share the same passion for technology, 
        innovation, and creativity.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mt-4">
        Our journey started as classmates, but over time, we grew into a strong team that supports and inspires one another. 
        Together, we aim to apply what we’ve learned, explore new opportunities, and create projects that reflect our skills 
        and teamwork.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mt-4">
        This website is one of the many steps in our journey, and we’re excited to share it with you.
